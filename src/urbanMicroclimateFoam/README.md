An open-source solver for coupled physical processes modeling urban microclimate based on OpenFOAM.

urbanMicroclimateFoam is a multi-region solver consisting of an air subdomain together with subdomains for porous urban building materials. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model solves the turbulent, convective air flow and heat and moisture transport in the air subdomain. A coupled heat and moisture (HAM) transport model solves the absorption, transport and storage of heat and moisture in the porous building materials. A radiation model determines the net longwave and shortwave radiative heat fluxes for each surface using a view factor approach.

The solver is tested for the following OpenFOAM versions:

* OpenFOAM-org (OpenFOAM Foundation) v6, v7, v8

### Usage

You can compile the solver for a specific OpenFOAM version by checking out the commit with corresponding tag. For example, for OpenFOAM v8:

	git clone https://github.com/OpenFOAM-BuildingPhysics/urbanMicroclimateFoam.git
	cd urbanMicroclimateFoam
	git checkout tags/of-org_v8.0
	./Allwmake

See the list of tags for different versions [here](https://github.com/OpenFOAM-BuildingPhysics/urbanMicroclimateFoam/tags)
