# Git LFS configuration for large binary files
# STL geometry files - use LFS for all STL files to handle large geometries
*.stl filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.STL filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# Note: STL files are typically geometry files used in OpenFOAM cases.
# Files range from ~500KB to several MB. Using LFS ensures efficient
# repository management and faster clones.
# Future: Add other large binary file types here if needed:
# *.obj filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.ply filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
